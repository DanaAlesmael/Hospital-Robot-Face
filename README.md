# Hospital-Robot-Face

Simple design was followed when designing the hospital robot's head, which is taken as a stand for the placed ipad. The reason for this was to avoid being over fancy as its body has various items attached such as icon, name, and decoration on the side. 

* The dimenssions were followed, as seen in the posted picture names IpadDim. 
* The stand has 4 holes on its base to help attaching it to the robot's body. 
* The Ipad cover was located ... for easier communication process. 
* The company's shortcut (SM) was attached to the back of the ipad stand to give the work credit.
